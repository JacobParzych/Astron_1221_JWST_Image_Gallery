    "This project creates a browsable catalog of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations with metadata organization and image visualization. We extract metadata from astronomical FITS files and organize them into Pandas DataFrames for analysis.\n",

    "### Astronomy Context\n",
    "The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), launched in 2021, is the most powerful space telescope ever built, observing in infrared wavelengths. FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) is the standard astronomical image format containing both image data and extensive metadata in \"headers.\" The `_i2d.fits` files we'll work with are processed, calibrated 2D images ready for scientific analysis."
