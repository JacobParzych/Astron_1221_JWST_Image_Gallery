# JWST Image Gallery Organizer

**Astronomy 1221 - Project 2: Data Wrangling and Analysis**  
**Authors:** Jacob Parzych & [Partner Name]

## Project Overview

This project creates a browsable catalog of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations with metadata organization and image visualization. We extract metadata from astronomical FITS files and organize them into Pandas DataFrames for comprehensive analysis.

## Astronomy Context

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), launched in 2021, is the most powerful space telescope ever built, observing in infrared wavelengths. FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) is the standard astronomical image format containing both image data and extensive metadata in "headers." The `_i2d.fits` files we work with are processed, calibrated 2D images ready for scientific analysis.

## Features

- **Direct Data Acquisition**: Download JWST FITS files using direct URLs from MAST Archive (similar to Lecture 14 approach)
- **Metadata Extraction**: Extract key observation parameters from FITS headers (upcoming)
- **Data Organization**: Organize metadata into Pandas DataFrames for easy manipulation (upcoming)
- **Catalog Filtering**: Filter observations by target, instrument, filter, and exposure time (upcoming)
- **Data Visualization**: Create comprehensive visualizations of observation patterns (upcoming)
- **Image Display**: Display actual FITS images with proper astronomical scaling (upcoming)
- **Data Export**: Save catalog to CSV for external use (upcoming)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JacobParzych/Astron_1221_JWST_Image_Gallery.git
cd Astron_1221_JWST_Image_Gallery
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Project2_Parzych_Jamison.ipynb
```

## Usage

### Running the Notebook

The notebook is currently organized for **systematic development**:

**Phase 1: Data Acquisition** ✅ (COMPLETE)
1. **Install Required Packages** - Set up the Python environment
2. **Import Libraries** - Load necessary modules
3. **Create Data Directory** - Set up file structure
4. **Download JWST FITS Files** - Direct URL downloads from MAST Archive
5. **Verify Downloads** - Confirm all files downloaded successfully

**Phase 2: Data Extraction & Organization** (Next Steps)
- Extract metadata from FITS headers
- Create Pandas DataFrame
- Clean and preprocess data

**Phase 3: Analysis & Visualization** (Future)
- Catalog filtering and sorting
- Summary statistics
- Visualization dashboard
- Image display

### Downloading JWST Data

The notebook uses **direct URL downloads** (similar to Lecture 14):

#### Direct Download Approach
The notebook includes code to download specific JWST Early Release Observations:
- Uses `urllib.request` for reliable downloads with progress bars
- Downloads specific `_i2d.fits` files from known JWST ERO programs
- Includes Southern Ring Nebula, Carina Nebula, and Stephan's Quintet
- Files saved to `./jwst_data/` directory

This approach is more reliable than API queries and demonstrates the method taught in class.

## Key Technologies

- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Astropy**: FITS file handling and astronomical computations
- **Astroquery**: Querying astronomical archives (MAST)
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations

## Results

The project generates:
- Comprehensive catalog of JWST observations in DataFrame format
- Summary statistics (target distribution, instrument usage, filter patterns)
- Visualization dashboard with multiple analysis plots
- Display of actual JWST images with astronomical scaling
- Exportable CSV catalog for further analysis

## Future Enhancements

- Color composite images from multiple filters
- Interactive web dashboard using Streamlit
- Sky coverage map showing observation locations
- Time series analysis of observation patterns
- Image quality metrics extraction
